# enableAPI

Instructions to run program:
1. Set up application to run in sandbox at https://enablebanking.com/cp/applications
2. Remember to save the private key generated after application registration in the same folder
3. Create a JSON file, called config.json and store it in the same folder. This file must contain your application ID, your private key file name and the redirect URL on the application.
4. Open a terminal/command prompt in this directory.
5. In terminal, type `python main.py` to run the application.
6. Follow application instructions.

Comments:
1. The application output has been developed keeping in mind that a user is using the application and someone with high technical knowledge.
2. Considering the point above, I have assumed that the user has python installed on their system.
3. There are a lot of commented lines with print statements that will show a developer the actual result of API calls.
